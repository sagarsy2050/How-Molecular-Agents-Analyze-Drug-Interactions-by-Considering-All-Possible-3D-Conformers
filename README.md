# Atomic-3D-Intelligence-Functional-Ontology-Multi-Agent-Collaboration
Ultimate Drug Discovery Engine  Generates low-energy 3D conformers, computes Gasteiger charges, dipole moments, PMI, and asphericity, embeds per-atom 3D coordinates and charge data into a complete OWL ontology, and runs 50+ atomic-level LLM agents via Ollama for deep SAR analysis.
